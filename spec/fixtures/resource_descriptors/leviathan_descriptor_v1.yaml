# A resource descriptor is a configuration file that defines the semantic data, states, and 
# state transitions associated with a particular resource independent of protocol and 
# media-type. Further, it also defines protocol specific templates for links that can be 
# included in the response and populated based on the associated state. By including optional 
# routes related metadata in the configuration, routes.rb mappings can be managed DRYly in 
# the resource descriptor file.
#
# The following sections facilitate a number of objectives including generating an ALPS profile 
# of the resource, generating human readable documents including sample representations, 
# decorating service responses, and scaffolding routes, controllers and models.

# Metadata associated with the resource that is used to publish the entry point to a discovery 
# service listing entry points for resources.

  Leviathans are bio-mechanoid ships that move freely among the stars.

# Semantic descriptors represent semantic definitions of data and thus in the context of ALPS 
# represent type='semantic' descriptors. Elements MAY include a sample value that can be used 
# to generate sample representations of the a resource in different media-types.
