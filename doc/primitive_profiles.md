# @title Primitive Profiles
# Overview
Crichton recognizes a number of primitive ALPS profiles that can be associated with fine-grained descriptors and are 
primarily used as types on primitive related [Data Descriptors](data_descriptors.md). These are:

* string, text: http://alps.io/schema.org/Text
* integer: http://alps.io/schema.org/Integer
* datetime: http://alps.io/schema.org/DateTime
